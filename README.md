TorchTools
==========

This must be the smallest functional mod I have ever seen...

Download
--------

We have downloads on [curseforge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/222980-torchools).

How it works:
-------------

Right click with any tool to use the "place" action with the next slot in your hotbar.<br>
Except on the first slot, there the last slot is used.

Thanks [Tinkers Construct](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287648-tinkers-construct) for the idea.
